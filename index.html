    <h2 class="subheader"><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
       
       <p>I am an aspiring software engineer. I am currently an Application Development and Testing student at Seattle Central through the Year Up program.</p>
       
       <p>Before starting the program, I worked in the customer service industry. I worked at BeachHouse Bar and Grill as a front of house staff member for 4 years. 
        I am a quick learner and adapted well in the restaurant while taking on different roles and responsibilities. I learned to establish professional and personal
        relationships with my coworkers and customers to improve the business as a whole. While working I attended the University of Washington and had the opportunity
        to take a java programming class, where my interest in computer science began. I am excited to take a challenging course load this year that will allow me to 
        develop the needed skillset to pursue a career in tech.</p>
    
       <p>I love analyzing and solving problems that involve critical thinking. Having these skills allowed to me be able to learn new skills and programming languages
        efficiently. I currently have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Microsoft Excel, and GitHub. Being able to make my own webpage and experiment with different 
        properties in CSS is my new favorite pastime. I am also eager to learn more programming languages and principles to expand my knowledge about software development!</p>
